name: Scrutinize
description: |
  The Scrutinize Skill represents the ability to understand
  motives and underlying intentions in others. It relies on
  hearing and vision to assess each participant’s part in a
  conversation; the way they intone their words, whether they
  fidget or look away as they speak and if their body language
  is unusual. Note that you can also deduce tone and intention
  from the written word, providing you possess the Education
  Skill. Finally, it can be used to recall things from memory.
  This Skill doesn’t allow you to see minute details, take
  account of numbers or see through an ambush – refer to the
  Awareness Skill in those cases.
