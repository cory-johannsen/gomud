  Gambling represents a general know-how for common
  games of chance with cards, dice and darts. Although anyone
  can make wagers and play games, some are more adept at
  spotting common mistakes and playing upon the weaknesses
  of their opponents. Although this Skill does
  not allow you to cheat, it does provide some
  insight as to the outcome of the game.
  Some GMs may simply prefer
  Players to roll dice contests in order to
  resolve high stakes gambling. Others
  may require you and the other Players
  around the table to play out an actual
  game of cards or dice amongst each other. This
  can be an exciting change of pace, presenting a
  colorful distraction from your normal gaming schedule. Y o u
  should feel encouraged to continue staying in-Character
