name: Rumor
description: |
  Rumor is used to gather information from social circles,
  stimulating conversation by being gregarious and talkative.
  It can be used to interact with strangers and friends alike,
  appealing to them with your personality or just chewing
  the fat. Unlike other social Skills such as Charm, Guile and
  Intimidate, this Skill is used to specifically appeal to larger
  groups by being an extrovert. Rumor is a good way to get
  the latest political or social news, dissect the latest gossip and
  spread rumors all at the same time. There is invariably a kernel
  of truth to be found in all of these and perhaps even particularly
  harmful dirt or secrets that may be revealed by this Skill.
