name: Counterfeit
description: |
  Counterfeit represents a pool of abilities utilized to falsify
  documents, making them appear official. This Skill is
  oftentimes used to duplicate signatures, handwriting styles
  and author other records. It’s also related to your ability to
  reproduce near-replicas of objets d’art, cobbling together a
  facsimile of a painting, statue, item of jewelry and a host of
  other items. In addition, Counterfeit can be used to forge
  currency and shave coins to dupe merchants and other pedlars
  from their wares and to embezzle money from others.
  In the case of most forged documents, you should already
  know how to read and write (as per the Education Skill). To
  reproduce other works, you must be able to craft the objects in
  question (as per the Tradecraft Skill). If you cannot read and
  write or craft, having the document or object you intend to
  reproduce will suffice (although your chances to succeed will
  likely suffer). Most importantly, you will never outright know
  whether the reproduction was successfully created or not. The
  only time you’d know whether the copy was successful or not
  is during the transaction with a Secret Test. Whenever you
  attempt to resell forged objects or pass them off as official or
  original, you may be required to employ use of Guile to spin
  a tale or give credence to the legitimacy of the Counterfeit.
