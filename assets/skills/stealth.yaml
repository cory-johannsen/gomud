name: Stealth
description: |
  Stealth represents the ability to use concealment, shadows,
  foliage, people and other distractions, to move about without
  being seen or heard, to hide and to lay in wait to ambush
  others. It can also be used stalk a mark while moving among
  crowds of others, and even to conceal large objects such as
  encampments, horses and wagons.
  When using the Stealth Skill to hide and conceal yourself,
  you must be outside the line of sight of those you intend to
  ambush or they must be pre-occupied with something else
  (the distraction of close combat isn’t enough). To cause a
  distraction, you may need to get creative. Whipping your
  horse and having it storm through the battlefield away from
  you is a good way to take everybody’s eyes off of you. Another
  is to wait until dark or walk amongst the crowds during the
  day, hiding in plain sight. Whenever you make a Stealth Test,
  it is always treated as a Secret Test
