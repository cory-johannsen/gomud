name: Navigation
description: |
  Navigation represents the ability to accurately determine
  distance, direction and routes across the world, orienteering
  over land and sailing over the sea. This Skill relies on
  landmarks and maps to find your way overland and the
  movement and alignment of the stars and constellations as
  the seasons pass, to help you find your way across the sea. You
  can use this Skill to plot a course towards a destination, taking
  into account the landscape, weather and roads so as to arrive
  in a faster time. Even in unfamiliar lands or on unfamiliar
  seas, you can chart a route should there be someone who can
  tell you what to look for or indicate prominent landmarks.
