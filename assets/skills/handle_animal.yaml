name: Handle Animal
description: |
  The Handle Animal Skill represents the ability to subdue,
  command and train creatures classified as Animals. Although
  this Skill doesnâ€™t allow those who use it to domesticate
  animals that are not meant to be domesticated, it does allow
  one to tame creatures. This Skill also teaches the proper way
  to care for and groom an animal, establishing a bond of trust
  and submission.
  You can use this Skill to coerce or tame those creatures
  classified as Animals. Chickens, dogs, horses, falcons, pigs
  and other farm creatures can easily be trained to obey you.
  However, should you wish to teach one of these animals more
  complex tricks you must teach it over nine consecutive days.
  If successful, you are master of the animal and it will learn
  one simple trick. You can never impart more than a number
  of tricks to a single animal in excess of your [FB], however.
