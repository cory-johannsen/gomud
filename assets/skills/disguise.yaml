name: Disguise
description: |
  The Disguise Skill represents the ability to masquerade as
  someone else, hide your own identity in public or conceal
  your true feelings from others. Theatrics and imitation are
  the foundation of any good disguise. The more you know
  about the people (or person) you’re trying to hide or mimic,
  the more effective your disguise.
  You can use this Skill in its most traditional way by
  employing tools of the trade to change your appearance
  – heavy cosmetics, appropriate clothing, different posture,
  regional accent and different behavioral traits or personality
  tics. Changing your appearance to look like that of another
  group of people or race will be easier if you have the appropriate
  clothes or know enough about their culture. Dressing as the
  opposite sex can be tough. However, disguises to imitate
  specific people can be much more difficult, particularly if you
  intend to traffic among people they know.
