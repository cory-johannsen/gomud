name: Bargain
description: |
  Bargain allows you to interpret the underlying factors of a
  commercial transaction, barter with trade goods, haggle over
  prices, find a common ground with another party, grease the
  wheels of commerce through use of bribery, appraise the
  worth of objects d’art and even procure illegal contraband.
  You can use this Skill in many different ways, but its most
  common use is to haggle over the price of goods. You may
  also use the Bargain Skill to appraise the worth of jewels,
  trade goods and even priceless relics of an age long past. Your
  Difficulty Rating may be improved if you have Skill Ranks in
  other Skills that may be related to the object you’re attempting
  to evaluate (such as having the Tradecraft Skill with a Focus
  in Tailoring to determine the value of a bolt of silk).
