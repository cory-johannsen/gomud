description: |
  Tradecraft represents the practice of a particular craft and
  the ability to run a business based off that craft. Although
  anyone with a Skill Rank in Tradecraft has the potential to
  practice any trade, Focuses give them a distinct advantage
  over their peers in particular fields. It takes time to learn and
  master such training.
  Tradecraft is used to construct and create a wide variety
  of things. Artistry can produce frescoes, paintings and
  sculptures. Brewing creates alcohol and flavored drinks
  such as teas and coffees. Carpentry can plank wood and
  construct anything from carts and wagons, to carriages, to
  multi-story houses and wooden fortifications. Engineering
  can oversee the construction of stonework homes, bridges,
  aqueducts, walls, towers, fortified manor homes and castles.
  Fine Smithery can work with jewelry, clockwork parts and
  even gunpowder weapons. Gastronomy is used to prepare
  culturally-appropriate and exquisite meals, far more complex
  than ones prepared using Survival. Metallurgy can be used
  to recognize, extract and reforge ores into alloys with the
  appropriate tools. A Shipwright can construct anything from
  river-going rafts to sea-going vessels. Smithing can work with
  practically any metal to create horseshoes, kettles, iron bands
  and wire. Stoneworking can be used to cut stones to fit the
  construction of larger buildings. Tailoring can work with cloth
  and other rare materials to clothe both the drecks of society
  as well as the cream. Tanning can produce rawhide, furs and
  refined leather goods. And finally, Weaponsmithing can be
  used to craft all manner of weapons.
