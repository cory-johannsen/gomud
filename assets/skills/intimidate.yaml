  Intimidation is the power to bully others into doing
  something you want. By using both physical appearance and
  verbal commands, you try to cow others before you, posturing
  aggressively like a dog ready to pounce. You attempt to terrify
  others with your words and actions, suggesting that youâ€™ll do
  violence upon them should they not back down. Similarly,
  you can use this Skill to cause others to back out of a fight,
  causing them to either shrink away from you or to stand
  proud but stay their hand
