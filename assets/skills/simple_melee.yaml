name: Simple Melee
description: |
  The Simple Melee Skill is employed when wielding common
  weapons in hand-to-hand fights and battles. Simple Weapons,
  such as a bullwhip, cudgel and woodsmanâ€™s axe are easy to
  use, require little training and are commonly carried on a
  belt. This Skill is gained by training with improvised weapons
  taken from the battlefield left shattered and abandoned or
  by being members of a militia. It also allows you to maintain
  the quality of Simple Melee weapons and perform general
  maintenance to keep them in usable condition.
