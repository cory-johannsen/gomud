description: |
  Charm is used to please others with flattery and pleasing
  words. A kind word, a soft smile, a pleasant handshake or hug
  may be used to illustrate your personal charms and enchant
  others. This Skill can modify the mood of others, persuading
  them towards your favor or causing them to change their
  opinions about things they may not necessarily support. It
  can be used to impress others with your affable nature or
  seduce those who may find you attractive.
  This Skill doesn’t allow you to produce lies, false accounts or
  con games – refer to the Guile Skill in those cases.
