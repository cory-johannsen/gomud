name: Alchemy
description: |
  Alchemy’s practitioners spend years divining the hidden
  secrets of true transmutation, although its everyday use tends
  to consist of concocting serums, pain relievers, abortifacients
  and other medicines. Alchemical compounds are created
  through various processes of heating and cooling substances.
  Drugs, poisons and other substances useful to adventurers can
  be crafted using this Skill. An alchemist’s laboratory tends to
  be a strange amalgam of scientific notes, erudite symbols of
  Magick, smells and boiling baubles
