name: Ride
description: |
  The Ride Skill is primarily used to mount and ride atop animals
  trained to bear others, such as horses and ponies. The Skill is
  to gallop and race, leap over hedges and fences, ride across
  difficult terrain, leap atop your mount while running or jumping
  from a window and to calm your mount when it is stressed.
  Much like the Drive Skill, unless you’re doing something
  out of the ordinary, a Test is not required to Ride an animal.
  However, Ride Tests are required if you want to attempt a
  difficult maneuver or race against others. Depending on the
  severity and inherent challenge of the maneuver, you may
  be required to roll multiple Ride Tests to successfully evade
  debris or navigate tight corners.
  Should you attempt to mount an untamed animal, you
  must succeed at a Ride Test. If successful, you to gain control
  of the creature for a number of minutes equal to your [AB].
  A Ride Test may also be required if you’re atop a dray horse,
  mule, palfrey horse or pony in tense situations. These animals
  are not accustomed to the battlefield and will often spook or
  attempt to bolt away when faced with the scent of blood or
  the clang of steel against steel.
