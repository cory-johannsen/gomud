name: Survival
description: The Survival Skill represents the ability to live out in the
  wilderness and live off the land. The Skill can be used to
  forage for roots, hunt for food, find suitable shelter, follow
  trails left behind by animals or people and locate somewhere
  safe to lay your head. In addition, it allows you to prepare
  simple meals, construct rudimentary weapons and build
  simple traps to hunt with. Providing you can locate the
  appropriate materials, you can construct rough items such
  as a wattle and daub house, a well, ladders, fences and other
  staples of peasant life.
