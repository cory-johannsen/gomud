name: Eavesdrop
description: |
  Eavesdrop allows you to listen to and perceive low sounds,
  usually conversations between two or more people. By
  listening to them or watching the movement of their lips, you
  can make out distinct sounds and determine the differences
  between mumbling and actual words. With a clear view of the
  people speaking, you can even pick up slight intonations and
  body language, giving further indication as to what is being
  said. You can also use it to hide the movement of your own
  lips to prevent Eavesdrop attempts on your conversations.
  Succeeding at an Eavesdrop Test doesnâ€™t give you all of
  the details of the conversation. Instead, you gain a general
  impression of what was said. For example, you see two
  courtiers in conversation, but do not hear exactly what they
  are saying, though certain words suggest that they are plotting
  an assassination attempt against a rival aristocrat.
