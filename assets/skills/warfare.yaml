  Warfare represents an understanding of warfare as it relates
  to war machines. This Skill is used to arm and reload the
  siege weapons intended to break down walls, smash doors,
  crash through an army’s defenses and wreak havoc upon
  an enemy’s supply lines; understand strategies utilized in
  warfare (both mobile and ensconced within a fortification)
  and how to erect appropriate defenses; and how to conduct
  psychological warfare upon the enemy. It also includes
  knowledge of how to construct siege towers, battering rams,
  bolt throwers, trebuchets and a host of gunpowder-type
  weapons. You can also use this Skill to identify wounded foes
  in large groups, able to isolate and strike the same one over
  and over amid an Engagement.
  You can also use this Skill to arm, aim and fire war. Identifying
  weakness in defenses is also another common use of this Skill.
  Although you may not be a stoneworker, you can identify
  where the strongest and weakest points are in a castle or other
  fortification.
  You can also use the Warfare Skill to commit military
  investment and provisioning to the war effort, to understand
  how to tactically deploy armies and to array artillery against a
  mobile enemy. With this knowledge, you can rapidly change
  the mode of conflict as necessary, adapting very quickly to
  your opponent’s movements en masse
