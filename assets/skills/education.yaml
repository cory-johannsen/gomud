description: |
  Education represents both literacy and schooling, but it
  extends far beyond merely being able to read and write. This
  Skill lends significant insight into the histories and practices
  of the world you live within. Education covers many different
  fields of study, each representing the study of a body of
  lore, possible academic research or ’rogue scholar’ pursuits.
  Although anyone with a Skill Rank in Education will have
  a basic understanding of various scholastic subjects, Focuses
  give them a specific specialization in an area of knowledge.
  While the Focuses above are the most commonly studied by
  the educated in a grim & perilous world, you can work with
  your GM to develop new ones.
