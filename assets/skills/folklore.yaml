name: Folklore
description: |
  Folklore represents a general, broad knowledge of the
  world around you. Unlike academic learning (such as per
  the Education Skill), it represents both second-hand and
  first person knowledge of the histories, traditions, faith and
  notable figures of a particular region. Drawn from the stories
  and oral traditions youâ€™ve heard from merchants, troubadours
  and family, it indicates an understanding of cultures other
  than your own. Its knowledge can also include the socially-
  accepted norms of both behavior and belief amongst the
  different social classes, including the courtesies to adopt and
  the proper forms of address to use.
  Besides being used to gain knowledge about the law, local
  history and institutions of your own culture, it can also be
  used to represent knowledge about geography, taboos, famous
  personalities, faith and even customs of people other than
  your own. You may be able to identify landmarks, secret
  signs left behind by other travelers, work out the movements
  and migrations of people and seek to understand the basic
  religious practices of your own region and others outside of
  it. You may also know what grows in the area, which parts are
  possibly dangerous and what the expected weather conditions
  will be.
