name: Interrogation
description: |
  Interrogation is the ability to draw answers from an unwilling
  subject using a variety of physical and emotional methods. It
  allows you to cause duress in your subject, inflicting mental
  fatigue upon them as you begin to get down to the heart of
  the truth. Interrogation often relies on torture, as you inflict
  bodily harm upon a subject to coerce them to speak the truth.
  A nasty mix of hot tar, branding irons, a cat’s paw, red-hot
  coals, thumbscrews, pliers and sharpened spoons to scoop
  out eyes are the most common trappings of any worthy Jailer.
  Torture devices such as the brazen bull, breaking wheels,
  iron maiden and the pear of anguish are often used by royal
  torturers. The only limit to what devices and methods you
  use during an interrogation is how far you’re willing to go to
  extract the desired information.
