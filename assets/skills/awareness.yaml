name: Awareness
description: |
  Awareness represents the ability to visually notice minute
  details and sounds, scents within the air, watch for ambushes,
  find hidden objects and spot contrivances designed to trap or
  kill. You’ll use Awareness not only to visually see, also to sense
  using smell, taste and touch. You may also use Awareness to
  estimate numbers and distances.
  This Skill doesn’t allow you to see through lies, sense
  motives or innuendo – refer to the Scrutinize Skill in those
  cases. If you wish to listen in on a conversation or distinctly
  make something out you heard, refer to the Eavesdrop Skill
  instead.
