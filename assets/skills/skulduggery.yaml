  There is nothing that is socially acceptable about the
  Skulduggery Skill, since it encapsulates practically everything
  larcenous or illegal that you might do using your hands. You
  can use this Skill to bypass locked doors and chests without
  a key to hand, disable security contrivances and complex
  traps, use simple prestidigitation to palm small objects and
  hide cards and conduct simple robberies, such as cutting coin
  purses and snatching bracelets.
  Skulduggery Tests are often tough to make if someone is
  watching. While you may be able to use this Skill to make
  small objects disappear in front of onlookers, it requires some
  form of distraction to do so. This is particularly helpful when
  attempting to cheat at cards! Similarly, using this Skill to
  snatch coin purses or cut pockets can be difficult unless you
  are amongst a crowd. Of course, there are simple techniques
  you can use to draw your markâ€™s attention away from.
