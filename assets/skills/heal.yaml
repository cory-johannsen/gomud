name: Heal
description: |
  The Heal Skill represents an acute understanding of the
  significance in the four humours of the body, how they relate
  to one another and how the wounded can be treated by
  paying heed to these temperaments. With this Skill, you can
  exercise this knowledge and how it relates to the excess of
  fluids which cause miasma and sickness.
  You can treat the ill and the healthy alike, tending to their
  needs for aches and pains, act as midwife, render abortifacients
  and even tend to the injured. You may adhere to a classical
  school of thought, using emetics and bloodletting to cure illness
  through humoralism. Or, you may prescribe to a mechanical
  school of thought, seeing the body as a complex machine that
  can be ’fixed’ with the right techniques. Regardless of which
  school you adhere to, those who practice the healing arts always
  pay some sort of lip service to the gods
