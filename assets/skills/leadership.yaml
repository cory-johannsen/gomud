name: Leadership
description: |
  Leadership is the ability to enlist the support of allies and
  followers, unifying them under your guidance against a
  common foe or cause. You can use this Skill to give tactical
  orders to forces under your command, much like a general
  does on the battlefield; to stir emotions and foment rebellion,
  such as an Anarchist extolling a crowd to storm the barricades;
  and to instill a belief in onlookers, such as a firebrand
  inspiring people toward a higher plane of spirituality.
