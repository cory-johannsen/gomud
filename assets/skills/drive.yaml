name: Drive
description: |
  Drive represents the ability to control common vehicles, 
  such as simple carts and wagons, passenger vehicles, semis 
  and even war machines such as tanks. The Skill is also
  used to maneuver vehicles round tight corners, race across
  the countryside, plow through a hedge and even roll over
  others should they stand in your way.
  Unless youâ€™re doing something out of the ordinary, a Test
  is not required to Drive a vehicle. However, Drive Tests
  are required if you want to attempt a difficult maneuver or
  race against others. Depending on the severity and inherent
  challenge of the maneuver, you may be required to roll
  multiple Drive Tests to successfully evade debris or navigate
  tight corners.
