name: Feast or Famine
description: A Camp Follower can prepare hearty feasts, re-shoe horses, stitch up torn clothing, empty chamber pots and attend to any number of other mundane activities that lift the morale of those around them. They are a fixture of any successful band of adventurers, well-compensated for their work.
effects:
  - You can attempt a Survival or Tradecraft Test to cook for others. If successful, a number of allies equal to your [FB] move one step up the Damage Condition Track positively, and recover their Peril Condition Track to Unhindered, whether theyâ€™re resting in a dangerous place or not. If your roll is a Critical Success, you affect a number of allies equal to three times your [FB] instead. A Character may only gain the benefit of this meal once per day, which takes an hour of time to prepare.
