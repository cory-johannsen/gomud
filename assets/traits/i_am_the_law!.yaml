name: I Am The Law!
description: The Reeve is so cold, they bleed ice – when they speak, they never need to repeat themselves. There are times when patrolling the roads over windswept moor and through dark forest, when a distinct show of force is necessary to cow a brigand or highwaymen, all it takes is a flash of their badge.
