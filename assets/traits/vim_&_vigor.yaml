name: Vim & Vigor
description: You are a virtuoso when it comes to swordplay. It takes little effort for you to size up your opponent, and when the opportunity avails, you make your mark upon their clothing â€“ a characteristic number or letter. This mark is how you and your fabled fencing skills will be known by in history.
effects:
  - Whenever you Parry a melee weapon, immediately make an Opportunity Attack against that same opponent. You may only make this attack if you are wielding a melee weapon possessing the Finesse Quality.
