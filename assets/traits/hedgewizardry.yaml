name: Hedgewizardry
description: The Hedgewise can harness the simplest of the ever-changing Winds of Magick far more naturally than their studiously, wizardly counterparts. They exhibit mastery over the smallest of spells, but maintain an ignorance towards others beyond their understanding.
effects:
  - When casting Generalist Magick – at your option – you may automatically succeed at the Incantation Test, but move one step down the Peril Condition Track negatively. You also understand how to use the Ritual of Magick Circle.
