name: Turn the Other Cheek
description: So as long as an Believer makes no attempt to harm another, they are above reproach. But those who walk in blood-stained clothes with a sword at their waist may send the wrong message, allowing others to ignore the Adherentâ€™s pacifist ways.
effects:
  - You can read, write and speak the language of any creature that is classified as a Humanoid (including player Ancestries). In addition, whenever you suffer Corruption, decrease the number you gain by 1 (to a minimum of one). This means that if you suffer 3 Corruption, you gain 2 instead.
