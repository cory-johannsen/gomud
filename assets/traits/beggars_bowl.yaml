name: Beggars Bowl
description: Hand outstretched, arm in a sling or leg strapped up to show only a stump. Your words and injuries might be honest or conniving and deceitful. Both will be supported by a long, sordid tale of the woes that befell you. Or you’ll harry your mark down the street, demanding compensation for their good fortunes while belaboring how the world is against you. Either way, they’ll drop a pfennig or two into your bowl – if only to shut you up.
effects:
  - Whenever you fail a Guile or Intimidate Test, you may re-roll to generate a better result, but must accept the outcome.
