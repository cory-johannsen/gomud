name: Dungeons Deep
description: You are not a prodigious person. In fact, finding a living, breathing Gnome below ground is rare indeed. They pass soundlessly throughout the caverns below the earth, roaming the ‘under dark’ in solitude. Besides, who would go looking after this much-maligned race of people in the first place?
effects:
  - You leave no trace of your passing in underground areas or caves whatsoever, unless discovered by Magick or at a Critically Successful Awareness Test.,
