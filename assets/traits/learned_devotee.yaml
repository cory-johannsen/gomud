name: Learned Devotee
description: Monks have spent many candle-lit hours studying the holy writ and ancient histories, laboriously transcribing many languages into the common tongue.
effects:
  - You can read, write and speak the language of any creature that is classified as a Humanoid (including player Ancestries). In addition, whenever you suffer Corruption, decrease the number you gain by 1 (to a minimum of one). This means that if you suffer 3 Corruption, you gain 2 instead.
