name: Hunger Pangs
description: You often forget their gustatory exploits until faced with extreme situations. Bracing flashbacks of these orgiastic meals are then triggered – mandrake root; rivers of mead; endless heaps of meat!
effects:
  - Whenever you successfully Resist the effects of Stress, Fear, Terror or other effects that force you to make a Resolve Test, you immediately gain the benefits of one dose of mandrake root. If this is a Critical Success, you gain the benefits of three doses instead. When under Hunger Pang’s effects, you do not suffer the drawbacks normally associated with taking mandrake root.,
