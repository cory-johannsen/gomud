name: Rabble-Rousing
description: Manipulating crowds with inflammatory words is one of the Anarchistâ€™s primary strengths. You foment rebellion with halftruths, interspersed with little white lies to egg others on. It also turns those so incited to their side, raising pitchfork and torch in their stead... that is, until things go terribly awry.
effects:
  - Whenever you fail a Guile or Leadership Test, you may re-roll to generate a better result, but must accept the outcome.
