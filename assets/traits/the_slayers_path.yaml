name: The Slayers Path
description: The world is a dark place, filled with loathsome abominations. When these fiends appear, the terrified populace calls upon madmen known as Slayers to kill them. They are foe hammer to such beasts, attacking with relentless furor!
effects:
  - After you have successfully defeated a creature (providing it is not a Humanoid or of a player Ancestry), its kind then becomes your chosen enemy. When attacking your chosen enemy, you always add a 1D6 Fury Die to melee weapon attacks. In addition, you are immune to the Intimidate Skill – along with Stress, Fear and Terror – used by these creatures. Note that there is no upper limit to the number of chosen enemy types a Slayer can have.
