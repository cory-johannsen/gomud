name: True Detective
description: The Investigator sometimes experiences visions, slivers of petty information which form a loose mosaic in the darkest recess of their mind. They possess the singular ability to disassociate reality and put the pieces of the puzzle back together in a way most donâ€™t even comprehend. Investigators could be geniuses, but they will certainly appear to be lunatics.
