name: Blessing in Disguise
description: You have been watched over by a god who favors them above all other Backgrounds. But perhaps this blessing represents the attentions of Abyssal fiends acting of their own accord, waiting to turn you into a thrall once your fate runs dry.
effects:
  - Whenever the time calls for you to suffer a debilitating Injury or face death, you may alternatively gain 1 permanent Chaos Rank (instead of spending a Fate Point) to ignore it entirely.,
