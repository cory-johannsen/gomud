description: |
  A rare few dabble in the darkest of Magicks. In its purest of forms,
  it is vile and destructive to others and soul-corrupting to the
  magician that wields it. You force the dark to kneel before you, but
  only after appropriating a suitable sacrifice.
effects:
  - While Channeling Power, you can voluntarily remove any number of Chaos Dice. However, you suffer 3 additional Corruption for each Chaos Die you remove.
