name: Blood Magick
description: |
  With great practice, you have learned to bend the powers of
  disorder to your whim. However, every dark gift requires a
  sacrifice in return.
effects:
  - After you have made the appropriate sacrifice of an innocent creature (a beloved animal for Petty Magick, a farm animal for Lesser Magick or a living person for Greater Magick), you can cause any one foe to automatically fail to Resist one cast Magick spell within the next 24 hours. You can only make a sacrifice like this once per day and will likely suffer Corruption for such a heinous act.
