name: Bad Axx!
description: |
  Armed with two insanely vicious weapons, you relentlessly cleave
  into the fray with both hands. This is a particular favorite of
  Dwarf Slayers whose predilection for this particular fighting style
  cannot be denied.
effects:
  - When you hold a one-handed melee weapon in either hand and fail a Martial Melee or Simple Melee Test, you may re-roll to generate a better result, but must accept the outcome. However, if you do not possess Ambidexterity, you must flip the results to fail the re-rolled Skill Test.
