name: Scrapheap Circle
description: A grimy court where the trailers are surrounded by piles of rusted metal and broken-down vehicles. Residents here make a living scavenging and repurposing scrap, and the constant clanging of metal can be heard at all hours. The whole area feels like a junkyard, with paths winding through stacks of discarded machinery and parts.
