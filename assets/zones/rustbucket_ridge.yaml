name: Ruskbucket Ridge
description: |
  From the outside, Rustbucket Ridge looks like a place forgotten by time and society, 
  where hope rusts just as fast as the metal trailers that line the dirt-packed roads. 
  The entrance is marked by a sagging, weather-beaten sign, its faded letters barely legible, 
  with vines and weeds crawling over it like nature trying to reclaim the land. A few flickering 
  lights hang on poles, casting a dim orange glow over the pothole-riddled ground, but most of the 
  park is shadowed, save for the faint glow of cracked neon signs from the trailers themselves.
  
  Each trailer looks like it’s been patched together with whatever scrap could be found—corrugated steel, 
  plywood, and sheets of plastic held together with duct tape and prayers. Rust stains streak the walls, 
  and windows are either boarded up or covered with tattered curtains. Trash piles up in the corners of 
  the lots, with old tires, broken appliances, and forgotten bits of tech lying in heaps like offerings
  to the apocalypse.
  
  A few beaten-down vehicles, long past their prime, sit idle in makeshift driveways, some stripped for 
  parts. The air smells of burning trash, oil, and something metallic, mixing with the distant sounds 
  of machinery clanking away from inside the trailers. From the outside, Rustbucket Ridge feels like a
  place where people don’t go to start over—they go to survive, holding on to the last remnants of a 
  life that the world left behind.
