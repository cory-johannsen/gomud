Bare-Handed|You were born with two hands and feet, and (hopefully) will live with all of them intact. Real weapons are far more effective, but a cross to the jaw, roundhouse kick to the kidney or knee to the groin sometimes speaks louder than words alone.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Pummeling, Slow|Brawling|0|0|Simple Melee
Battle Axe|This weapon is vicious and heavy, often favored by dwarves and Berserkers. Overly-cumbersome, they’re usually adorned with skulls – just for the hell of it.|0|One or two-handed|Engaged|Adaptable, Slow|Bladed|2|40|Martial Melee
Blackjack|This is nothing more than a glorified leather sack full of lead shot, or alternatively an officer’s club. Generally, it’s guaranteed to knock the sense into or out of anyone it is used against.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Powerful, Pummeling|Brawling|1|20|Simple Melee
Bullwhip|This is a common tool for ranchers and animal tamers; more intimidating than useful. Despite the fanciful stories Antiquarians have spun, it cannot hold your weight if used to swing across a chasm.|0|One-handed|Engaged or 1 meter|Entangling, Ineffective, Reach|Brawling|1|100|Simple Melee
Court Sword|Fast and efficient, this blade is carried by both blue-bloods and dandies. Many are unsharpened, carried as status symbol by the latter (but just as dangerous as a poisoned word with the former). Beware ill words with the fop whose expertise in fencing may result in a duel to the death.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Fast, Finesse|Bladed|1|140|Martial Melee
Cudgel|Basically a large shillelagh, and that’s roughly it. Found in abundance in any old growth forest or detritus pile on a farm, the good ones are bigger and studded at the end.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Light, Powerful, Weak|Crushing|100|Simple Melee
Dirk|Slender and sharp, this is used to either cut your meat or your enemy.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Fast, Finesse, Light, Weak|Bladed|1|100|Simple Melee
Estoc|This needle-like sword is useless for slashing anything more than loose parchment. Its thrust, however, is deadly sharp.|0|One or two-handed|Engaged|Adaptable, Finesse|Bladed|2|140|Martial Melee
Flanged Mace|A metal version of the cudgel, it comes in a myriad of designs. Used by priests because they are ‘gentler’ than a blade, though many caved-in skulls rebuke this fact.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Powerful|Crushing|1|100|Martial Melee
Fire-Hardened Spear|Often fashioned from a large branch and a broken piece of metal, it’s heated to make it more robust. Not surprisingly, it’s the favorite implement of outlanders and the desperate.|0|One or two-handed|Engaged or 1 meter|Adaptable, Reach, Weak|Bladed|2|140|Simple Melee
Garrotte|Often made from cat muscle or steel wire attached between two spools, this is an assassin’s weapon. The skilled can put people to sleep permanently, whereas the unskilled will butcher the victim’s neck in the process, to the sound of much gurgling and screaming.|0|Two-handed|Engaged|Entangling, Fast, Ineffective|Brawling|1|40|Simple Melee
Improvised Hand Weapon|These are weapons that shouldn’t really be weapons. It could be an ale stein, a stool, pots and pans, a fire poker, a salted leg of pork; the list goes on. They are generally useful in bar scuffles and emergencies, laughable otherwise.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Pummeling|Varies|1|Varies|Simple Melee
Knuckleduster|The ‘gentleman’s friend’ is for the more discerning brawler. It can be bought on the open market, but is often improvised from gloves stitched with weighty rings or even a few skeleton keys gripped between the fingers.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Fast, Pummeling|Brawling|1|140|Simple Melee
Main Gauche|Now this is a knife. Favored by swashbucklers and daredevils, they’re wielded in an off-hand to parry blows.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Defensive, Finesse, Weak|Bladed|1|20|Martial Melee
Military Lance|Wrought of wood and metal, this spear is commonly used to tilt at windmills or at other knights. It can only be used one-handed|while in the saddle.|0|One or two-handed|Engaged or 1 meter|Powerful, Reach, Vicious|Bladed|3|20|Martial Melee
Misericorde|This ancient word translates into mercy blade, used commonly to grant swift death to fatally-wounded knights. It grants a swift death to peasants, too.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Fast, Finesse|Bladed|1|40|Martial Melee
Morgenstern|This is a round-headed club, dotted with small barbs and tipped with a stout iron spike. Viscera has a tendency to stick to its barbs in a most gruesome fashion. Morgenstern are never topped with rattling chains affixed to iron spheres; those are weapons of pure fantasy or historic ignorance.|0|One or two-handed|Engaged|Adaptable, Powerful, Vicious|Crushing|2|100|Martial Melee
Machete|The most common weapon for explorers, it is useful and evokes little fuss. Not surprisingly, it tends to cleave violently – thus its namesake.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Vicious|Bladed|1|200|Martial Melee
Pike|A very long, hard stick – making it the weapon of choice for any imperial army which fields great phalanxes of pike men. Its conical iron spearhead is purposefully reinforced with ‘cheeks’ along the flange of the shaft. Folk oftentimes say ‘the bigger the pike, the smaller the you-know-what’.|0|Two-handed|Engaged or 1 meter|Finesse, Reach|Bladed|3|20|Martial Melee
Pole Cleaver|A very long stick with an axe on the end. It’s far more intimidating than a pike, but less embarrassing than a mere butcher’s cleaver. Soldiers often partake in ‘Gygaxian musings’ over the vast array of pole arms that dominate weapon racks – in which the pole cleaver is called by a variety of names.|0|Two-handed|Engaged or 1 meter|Reach|Bladed|3|80|Martial Melee
Rapier|Not to be confused with the fanciful court sword, this is the standard weapon of civilians. It’s a deadly tool in the proper hands, but little more than an unwieldy sharp crowbar for the inept.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Fast, Finesse, Weak|Bladed|1|2400|Simple Melee
Sabre|Arm of choice for both cavalry and to give airs that you know what you’re doing. Many Veterans hang their sabre in honor of the blood and sanity they shed for whatever nameless count marched them off to war.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Defensive|Bladed|1|120|Martial Melee
Shiv|A sliver of metal or broken piece of glass wrapped in leather, it has made the difference between life or death for both the imprisoned and the desperate.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Fast, Weak|Bladed|1|40|Simple Melee
Maul|Both a carpenter’s and a mason’s tool, it’s one-part axe and one-part hammer. Verily, an easy choice for rioting peasants or an adventurer who is short on money but efficient with scavenged farming tools.|0|Two-handed|Engaged|Slow, Weak|Bladed|3|80|Simple Melee
Staff|Mostly used as walking sticks by the scholarly and elderly, travelers swear by it (particularly ten-foot long poles). Proper ones are beautifully designed and weighted, while poor ones are simply gnarled tree limbs.|One or two-handed|0|Engaged|Adaptable, Defensive, Pummeling|Crushing|2|20|Simple Melee
Stiletto|Another weapon favored by the assassin, it’s concealable and designed for quick stabbing thrusts. An intended victim can bleed like a stuck pig if this weapon is thrust in the right way.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Fast, Vicious, Weak|Bladed|1|480|Simple Melee
Threshing Flail|As a farmer’s tool, it’s used to separate grain from husks. In other hands, it can be used to bash about raiders who steal farming supplies or foolish lords that demand too much grain. Although it possesses a long reach, it looks rather foolish when whirled around above the head.|0|One or two-handed|Engaged|Adaptable, Weak|Crushing|2|20|Simple Melee
Torch|Swabbed in oil and rough cloth, torches are oftentimes used by peasants and witch hunters to burn cruel lords and heretics. Rarely are torches employed otherwise, unless one is so inclined to descend into a tomb to rob it.|0|One-handed|Engaged|Immolate, Ineffective, Slow |Crushing|1|30|Simple Melee
War Hammer|The trademark weapon of your favorite Uncle Siggy. Big, laborious, terrifying; much like its wielders. This hammer was crafted for war, not driving nails.|0|Two-handed|Engaged|Powerful, Slow|Crushing|3|100|Martial Melee
Woodsman's Axe|Perfect for felling trees, splitting logs and dismembering raiders, the axe is the perfunctory tool of foresters. Sometimes, they are edged with silver in case of attack by the supernatural.|0|One or two-handed|Engaged|Adaptable, Slow, Weak|Bladed|2|80|Simple Melee
Zweihänder|Sometimes, it is called a bastard sword (mostly because you will be cursing whoever wields it). Other times, it’s called a great sword (partially because it requires wide berth to swing it). However, it is far more efficient and wieldy than its predecessor, the ubiquitous war hammer.|0|Two-handed|Engaged or 1 meter|Punishing, Reach, Slow|Bladed|3|240|Martial Melee
Arquebus|This long-range matchlock gun is the predecessor to the far-superior musket. Arquebuses are notoriously unreliable and useless when its raining, as the fuse is invariably snuffed out.|4|Two-handed|6+[PB] meters|Gunpowder, Volatile|Gunpowder|3|26400|Martial Ranged
Arbalest crossbow|Wound by hand and cranequin-driven, the bolt unleashed by this weapon can decapitate nearly anything at a pace of a few meters. Any further, and it produces merely a bloody ruin.|2|Two-handed|9+[PB] meters|Fast, Punishing|Missile|3|2400|Martial Ranged
Blunderbus|This wheellock hand cannon is stuffed with blackpowder, boot nails and pebbles – for when you absolutely, positively, have to kill everyone in the room?Accept no substitute.|4|Two-handed|3+[PB] meters|Gunpowder, Shrapnel, Volatile, Weak|Gunpowder|3|6240|Simple Ranged
Bolas|Useful for capturing dogs or prey on the run; both despicable curs.|1|One-handed|1+[PB] meters|Entangling, Ineffective, Throwing|Missile|1|40|Simple Ranged
Bottle bomb|Generally sparked by a demagogue’s fiery rhetoric, this rudimentary incendiary sets its enemies aflame upon contact.|1|One-handed|1+[PB] meters|Fiery, Ineffective, Throwing, Volatile|Explosive|1|240|Simple Ranged
Composite bow|Used in militias for its great range, they’re entirely worthless in any close encounter… which is why archers always carry a backup knife.|2|Two-handed|12+[PB] meters|Fast, Finesse|Missile|3|3360|Martial Ranged
Dragon pistol|This wheellock scattergun is used for kicking arse and chewing tobacco – especially when you are all out of tobacco.|4|One-handed|1+[PB] meters|Gunpowder, Shrapnel, Volatile, Weak|Gunpowder|2|19200|Martial Ranged
Dueling pistol|Ostentatious and unusually decorated, these flintlock pistols are deadly quick. A true ‘gentleman’s’ weapon, if there ever was one to be named.|3|One-handed|3+[PB] meters|Gunpowder|Gunpowder|2|24000|Martial Ranged
Flintlock pistol|Much like the arquebus, these pistols are inefficient when firing in bad weather. However, it is the mainstay weapon of choice for highwaymen and soldiers of fortune.|3|One-handed|3+[PB] meters|Gunpowder, Volatile|Gunpowder|2|9600|Martial Ranged
Francisca|A balanced throwing axe, it’s good for splitting pumpkins or noggins at range. Strangely, both make similar sounds when struck.|1|One-handed|1+[PB] meters|Throwing, Weak|Missile|1|960|Simple Ranged
Hunting bow|Lightweight and easy to wield, these bows are favored by forest stalkers. They have a strong pull, but not strong enough to split an arrow in twain.|1|Two-handed|9+[PB] meters|Finesse, Weak|Missile|3|1920|Simple Ranged
Improvised Throwing Weapon|Bottles of beer, a brass pitcher, a sizable rock, a lead plate or even a pair of boots are all serviceable enough to be flung. Mostly, they serve as a minor annoyance.|1|One-handed|1+[PB] meters|Pummeling, Slow, Throwing|Missile|1|0|Simple Ranged
Javelin|Used both in sport and murder, these short spears are carried by the half dozen. The range it can be thrown is a point of pride on both fields.|1|One-handed|3+[PB] meters|Throwing, Weak|Missile|1|120|Simple Ranged
Light crossbow|These are lighter versions of the arbalest, their strings hand-drawn by a crank. They’re typically used as weaponry for peasant militias, or as playthings for lordly children too nearsighted or clumsy to draw a bowstring.|2|Two-handed|6+[PB] meters|Fast, Punishing, Weak|Missile|3|1440|Simple Ranged
Longbow|Used by scouts and raiders, these great bows as tall as a man are the cause of many a death at archers’ hands. The mere length of the arrows they fire is enough to put a well-hung Ogre to shame.|1|Two-handed|12+[PB] meters|Finesse|Missile|3|24000|Martial Ranged
Musket|Incredibly expensive, this percussion cgun is intimidating enough that it doesn’t really matter whether you load it or not. Deadly accuracy and reliability make them the best of class among gunpowder weapons.|4|Two-handed|9+[PB] meters|Gunpowder|Gunpowder|3|67gc|Martial Ranged
Shepherd’s sling|Used to deter wolves from flocks of sheep, they can be used to fell the greatest of goliaths if slung correctly.|1|One-handed|3+[PB] meters|Fast, Throwing, Weak|Missile|1|40|Simple Ranged
Janky 38|Although considered to be the king of all pistols, they are inaccurate and make an incredibly intimidating explosive sound when fired. Given the amount of gunpowder stuffed into the three barrels, it is no wonder that they’re notorious for exploding in the wielder’s hand.|4|One-handed|3+[PB] meters|Gunpowder, Repeating, Volatile|Gunpowder|2|83gc|Martial Ranged
Throwing knife|This small blade is the staple of vagabonds and cut throats. Well-balanced ones can be juggled and pierce any thrown apple… often to reluctant applause.|1|One-handed|1+[PB] meters|Fast, Finesse, Throwing, Weak|Missile|1|480|Simple Ranged
