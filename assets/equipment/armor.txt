Clothing|Unfortunately, this is nothing more than the attire you’re wearing and the skin on your back. Obviously not very good for deflecting anything other than a scrape from a fall, but it keeps your organs and blood inside where it belongs – you can’t fault it for that. If you are wearing any other sort of armor over your clothing (which your Character likely is), you ignore both its Dangerous and Natural Qualities.|0|Dangerous,Natural|0|0|0

Hide armor|Made from heavy skins, often bear or wolves pelts, this armor is common in colder climes. Most of its protection comes from the sheer amount of hair and layering of furs, though the skin is tanned beneath.|1||3|0|2880
Quilted armor|Cheap and easy to move around in, this is standard equipment for penny-poor soldiers. Those who die wearing this armor often look like gutted rag dolls.|1||2|0|5280
Leather armor|This is the standard issue armor for well-paid mercenaries. The leather type depends on the location; most of it is boiled and hardened cowhide, but sets made from sharkskin on the coast or lizardhide in the deep south are not uncommon.|2||3|0|9600
Brigandine|Cloth on the outside, metal plates on the inside. Worn often by travelling lords, this otherwise studded or banded leather offers protection whilst reflecting the latest of fashion. It’s by far the best set of armor you can wear without feeling like an overturned tortoise. Oftentimes, this armor is accompanied by a codpiece shaped into a grinning moon-like face.|3||4|0|15840
Mail armor|Made of interlocking metal rings, mail (mistakenly called chain mail by the untested) is worn under the military coat of high-ranking officials to provide sleek protection. It slinks like a pocket of coins when worn, but definitely life-saving on the battlefield.|4|Heavy|5|0|31200
Munitions plate|This is none other than second-hand plate armor used to outfit state-sponsored soldiers in a hurry. Although it only covers the torso and upper limbs, it is still the best armor you can get if you weren’t born with a silver spoon in your mouth. It tends to rattle terribly when running and grates annoyingly when walking.|5|Heavy|6|0|42240
Full plate|Expensive and clunky, it covers the entire body from toe to crown. It generally requires help to don and doff, and unfortunately can only be worn for short periods of time because it is so uncomfortable. It is often found gathering dust in alcoves of mansions or harnessed to knights that demand an impeccable appearance.|6|Heavy|7|0|85920
