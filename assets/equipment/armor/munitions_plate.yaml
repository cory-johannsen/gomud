name: Munitions plate
description: This is none other than second-hand plate armor used to outfit state-sponsored soldiers in a hurry. Although it only covers the torso and upper limbs, it is still the best armor you can get if you werenâ€™t born with a silver spoon in your mouth. It tends to rattle terribly when running and grates annoyingly when walking.
