name: Brigandine
description: Cloth on the outside, metal plates on the inside. Worn often by travelling lords, this otherwise studded or banded leather offers protection whilst reflecting the latest of fashion. Itâ€™s by far the best set of armor you can wear without feeling like an overturned tortoise. Oftentimes, this armor is accompanied by a codpiece shaped into a grinning moon-like face.
