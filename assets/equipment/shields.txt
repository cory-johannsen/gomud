Buckler|This hand-held shield is generally no broader than a dinner plate. Often used in training and duels, it’s entirely useless against anything larger than a training sword. You can use it to block arrows if you have the reflexes of a cat.|One-handed|Defensive|1|0|480
Wooden shield|These shields are bought and painted beautifully, though among poorer soldiers they’re simply barrel lids or rotted, reappropriated oak doors. It actually provides a solid amount of defense – as long as they are not splintered or set ablaze.|One-handed|Defensive,Light|1|0|960
Metal shield|Sturdy and able to actually deflect blows instead of absorb them, many of these metal-rimmed escutcheons are dented and rusted from use. In a pinch, it can also be used to bash someone’s face in.|One-handed|Defensive,Protective|2|0|1440
