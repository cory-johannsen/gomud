description: The gods are fickle and your family raised you to fear and respect their capricious ways. You may have been raised by priests or nuns, attending religious school every week and performing in too many religious plays to count. Perhaps you were orphaned and sat on the street corner, memorizing the words of doomsayers or street prophets. Regardless, their dogma has taught you to be strong of heart and will.
