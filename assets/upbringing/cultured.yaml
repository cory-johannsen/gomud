description: Entertainers, painters and parties made you what you are today. From the penny theatres on the street corners to the auditoriums of playhouses, you were immersedin cultures other than your own since birth. You were taught the value of expression, pride in your abilities, and not to trust anyone else easily. You have developed a sharp eye and an even sharper tongue.
