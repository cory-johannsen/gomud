name: Forgotten
stat: Quickness
description: You were raised outside common society and had little opportunity to integrate until now. Maybe you grew up on the streets, were raised by wolves or are the last scion of a noble house. Being from an outcast family afforded benefits, but today, you have nothing but yourself to rely upon. You became quick and lithe, but you feel as if there is a hole in your life.
