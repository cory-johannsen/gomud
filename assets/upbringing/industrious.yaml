name: Industrious
stat: Muscle
description: The lot of most people, you were born into a family of hard laborers. Whether they be servants, farmers, craftsmen or engineering nobles, your family forced you to work to put food on the table for you and your doubtless countless siblings. Your hands are chapped and hard, your back rippling and your demeanor rough. You prefer to do things yourself rather than to pay others to do it for you.
