name: The Keg Hole
description: A run-down trailer that Big Grizz, a former bar bouncer, has converted into a low-class dive bar. It’s packed with mismatched chairs, tables made from scrap wood, and barrels of his infamous homebrew. It’s a hotspot for seedy negotiations and drunken brawls. Grizz doesn't ask questions as long as you pay and don’t break his stuff.
