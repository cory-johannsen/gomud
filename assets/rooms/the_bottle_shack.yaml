name: The Bottle Shack
description: This is Whiskey Joeâ€™s trailer, a former bartender who now distills his own liquor from whatever he can find. Joe runs an unofficial bar out of his trailer, trading moonshine and stories with anyone who passes through. His trailer is surrounded by empty bottles, and a smoky fire pit is usually burning nearby.
