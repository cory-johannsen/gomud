name: Wrecker's Rest
description: A camp site where The Twins, a duo of scavengers named Vic and Vee, operate. They live out of a beaten-up RV and spend their days sifting through the heaps of scrap around them. Their camp is surrounded by half-melted mannequins and broken droids they use for spare parts.
