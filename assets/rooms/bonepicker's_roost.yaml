description: Old Man Tully, a former undertaker, lives in this decrepit trailer surrounded by macabre trophies. Tully scavenges anything he finds from abandoned homes or grave sites, storing his collection of eerie artifacts in plain sight. His trailer has the feel of a crypt, and Tully himself seems like a relic of the old world.
