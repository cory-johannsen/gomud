name: The Furnace
description: A large, rundown trailer owned by Big Hank, a burly blacksmith who forges scrap metal into weapons and tools. His trailer doubles as his workshop, with glowing embers and a forge burning outside. The constant clanging of metal and the roar of flames make this place feel like an industrial wasteland.
