name: Ghostâ€™s Rest
description: A camp site set up by Wraith, a drifter who claims to have no past. His camp consists of a small, battered tent and a few scattered belongings, always shifting as he never stays long. Wraith is known to vanish for days at a time, and rumors swirl that he has ties to the supernatural, though no one knows for sure.
