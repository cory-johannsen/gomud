name: Smoker's Den
description: Ember, a former firefighter turned arsonist, occupies this trailer. It’s surrounded by smoking piles of debris and half-melted objects from her destructive tendencies. Ember is a master of controlled burns and uses her skills to dispose of evidence—or people—when necessary. Her trailer constantly smells of smoke, and a faint haze lingers in the air.
