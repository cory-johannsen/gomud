name: The Heap
description: This trailer is a cobbled-together monstrosity, owned by Old Rusty, a legendary scavenger known for his ability to find and repurpose almost anything. The trailer is half-buried in a mountain of scrap metal, with makeshift extensions welded onto it. It's impossible to tell where the junk ends and the trailer begins.
