name: Boneyard Bend
description: A quiet, eerie court where the trailers are more spaced out, many abandoned and crumbling. The few residents left here are reclusive, and the area is littered with the remnants of a past life—broken toys, old furniture, and personal relics long forgotten. It has an almost haunted feel, with the rusting shells of trailers standing like gravestones.
