name: The Razor Nest
description: A camp site occupied by Flea, a twitchy, wiry pickpocket and thief. Flea’s small tent is hidden among piles of junk and debris, and he’s known for disappearing into the shadows at a moment’s notice. He’s a low-level crook who survives by stealing from others, and his camp is littered with stolen goods, waiting to be fenced.
