name: The Mausoleum
description: Grim Pete runs this eerie trailer, which looks more like a tomb than a home. It’s covered in dark, weather-beaten panels and adorned with skulls and other morbid symbols. Pete is known for his obsession with death and decay, and locals come to him when they need to dispose of things—often bodies, or items best forgotten.
