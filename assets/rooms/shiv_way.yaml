description: The most dangerous court in Rustbucket Ridge, known for its gang activity and frequent brawls. The trailers are heavily fortified, with makeshift barricades and barbed wire. The residents here are tough, quick to violence, and often involved in the criminal underworld. This is not a place to wander into lightly, as it lives up to its nameâ€”people here are always armed and ready for a fight.
