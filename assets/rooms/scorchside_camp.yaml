name: Scorchside Camp
description: This camp site is occupied by Sooty Joe, a drifter who survives by burning trash and selling scavenged materials. His tent is surrounded by piles of ash and the remains of burnt-out objects. Joe always seems to have a small fire going, and he trades in charred items that others might find useless but still hold value in a post-apocalyptic world.
