name: The Still
description: Owned by Moonshine Mary, a notorious bootlegger who distills potent liquor from anything she can scrounge up. Her trailer is surrounded by barrels and old stills, with a thick, acrid smell of fermenting alcohol always in the air. Mary runs an underground bar from her trailer, offering drinks strong enough to make you forget the world’s problems—if you survive them.
