name: Blood Camp
description: Scar, a vicious mercenary, squats in this run-down camp site. His tent is made from patched-together tarps, and his area is marked by crude barricades of scrap metal and broken-down vehicles. Scar has a reputation for solving problems with violence and is often hired to settle disputes or enforce debts.
