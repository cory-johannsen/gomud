name: Ashen Hollow
description: This trailer belongs to Burner Bill, the local pyromaniac. Bill runs makeshift bonfires out of whatever flammable junk he can find. His trailer is a scorched husk, and the ground around it is charred black from constant burnings. Bill is known for his love of destruction and will burn anything for the right price.
