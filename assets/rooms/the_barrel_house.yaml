name: The Barrel House
description: Whiskey Pete runs this trailer-turned-distillery, a ramshackle operation built from salvaged barrels and broken-down machinery. He specializes in rotgut—cheap, harsh liquor that barely qualifies as drinkable. Pete trades his booze for favors, and while his drinks may be terrible, they’re strong enough to keep his regulars coming back.
