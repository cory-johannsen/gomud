name: The Slasher's Den
description: This trailer belongs to Grit, a former gang leader who’s turned Shiv Way into his personal turf. Grit’s trailer is heavily fortified, with armed guards often lurking outside. It’s a hub for illegal dealings, weapon sales, and brawls. Inside, the trailer is filled with loot from years of crime, and Grit runs the show with an iron fist.
