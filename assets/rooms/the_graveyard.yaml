name: The Graveyard
description: Owned by Silent Lucy, a mysterious woman who rarely speaks. Her trailer is surrounded by old, rusted-out vehicles and relics of the past, like a graveyard for forgotten machines. Lucy is a loner, living among these broken remnants, and some say sheâ€™s more comfortable with the dead than the living.
