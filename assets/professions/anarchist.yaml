name: "Anarchist"
archetype: "Influencer"
description: "When firebombs rain down on town hall, nobles are in the stocks and pelted with fruit and even when the tax on beer is lowered, the Anarchist stands in the shadows laughing. At best a champion of causes – at worst a chaotic nihilist – the Anarchist lives to foment change. Organizing rallies, leading protests, exhorting for change from street corners, or tarnishing a noble’s reputation, the Anarchist revels in the thrill of it. Though some do believe in the causes they extol, many simply want to see authority wither and power crumble. And if the Anarchist is richly rewarded once change is enacted, then that is merely coincidence.  Anarchists are not immune to their own tricks. For every five revolutions that go right, one goes wrong and the Anarchist ends up on the run from very powerful enemies. In which case, the life as an insignificant adventurer is often the perfect alibi for the excommunicated or exiled rabble-rouser. Sometimes however, their lies and triumphs can come back to bite them. Whether a scorned aristocrat with a penchant for torture or a count overthrown as a dictator, both can to be powerful enemies should the Anarchist be the cause of their downfall. Then the Anarchist is likely to find themselves back in the public forum they once loved, flogged… or even worse."

  name: "Rabble-Rousing"
  description: "Manipulating crowds with inflammatory words is one of the Anarchist’s primary strengths. You foment rebellion with halftruths, interspersed with little white lies to egg others on. It also turns those so incited to their side, raising pitchfork and torch in their stead... that is, until things go terribly awry."
  effect: "Whenever you fail a Guile or Leadership Test, you may re-roll to generate a better result, but must accept the outcome."
