  effect: "After you have successfully defeated a creature (providing it is not a Humanoid or of a player Ancestry), its kind then becomes your chosen enemy. When attacking your chosen enemy, you always add a 1D6 Fury Die to melee weapon attacks. In addition, you are immune to the Intimidate Skill – along with Stress, Fear and Terror – used by these creatures. Note that there is no upper limit to the number of chosen enemy types a Slayer can have."

  effect: "In order to follow the Slayer’s Path, you can never wear armor as it violates this tenet. Should you don armor, you do not gain the benefits of any Professional Trait – Slayer or otherwise – that you possess."
