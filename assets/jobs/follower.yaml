name: "Follower"
archetype: "Influencer"
description: "Followers have dedicated their lives (and fortunes) to person or cause without consideration for whether that's a good idea.  They have incredibly deep knowledge of the subect they follow, but not much else."
tier: "Basic"
reward_point_cost: 100
trait:
  name: "Cult of Personality"
  description: "The Cultist can harness the ever-changing Ætheric Winds as the wellspring of their Magick. They exhibit mastery over the smallest of spells, but ignorance towards others beyond their understanding."
  effect: "When casting Generalist Magick – at your option – you may automatically succeed at the Incantation Test, but move one step down the Peril Condition Track negatively. You also understand how to use the Ritual of Blessed Sacrament."
special_trait:
  name: "Divine Magick"
  description: "You are a proxy to a distant god, calling for divine intervention with the utterance of sacred prayers."
  effect: "You are solely a practitioner of Divine Magick. As a consequence, you may never adopt a Job which has Arcane Magick as a Special Trait. In addition, you immediately learn three Generalist Magick spells when you enter this Job. If you gained Divine Magick from a previous Job, you learn an additional Generalist Magick spell instead."
drawback:
  name: "Cruel Tutelage"
  description: "As Cultists are wholly self-taught in the ways of Magick, the practice of their spells is messy and chaotic. Fortunate for Abyssal Princes sensitive to this errant way of thinking, Cultists and their ilk make easy prey, leading them down a path towards the blackest and most soul-corrupting of Magicks."
  effect: "When you generate face ‘1’ or ‘6’ with Chaos Dice, you invoke a Chaos Manifestation."
