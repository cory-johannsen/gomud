name: Beggar
archetype: Criminal
description: |
  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer in these trying
  times, with the Beggar evidence of just how poor you can
  get. Beggars are common in large cities, drifting in crowded
  marketplaces and digging in rubbish piles hoping for a piece
  of scrap. Every small town its own local tramp, or Beggar.
  Any number of misfortunes can drive you to the life of a
  Beggar: debilitating sickness, a terrible war wound or even
  psychological scarring. Such erstwhile unfortunates make their
  lives on the streets, clutching a chipped and cracked alms bowl
  to beg for a pfennig. Here they learn various underhanded
  skills and to know who will fill their bowls and who will kick
  them in the stomach. Few burghers and even fewer aristocrats
  have any sympathy for these poor wretches. Beggars remain
  stalwart and strangely optimistic that their lot will improve.
  Leaving behind the broken bowl and picking up a stolen
  knife to become an adventurer is a way to improve their
  lot; many see it as an infinitely better alternative to slogging
  through muddy streets and eating dead rats. Having become
  convinced that society doesnâ€™t care for them, adventuring
  Beggars find little hope, the true nature of the universe being
  equally as uncaring. This has led many Beggars back where
  they started, sobbing in alleyways and jumping at shadows,
  even more scarred.
