name: Roid Rager
archetype: Aggressor
description: |
  The spark of life kindles the hearts of some and engulfs others.
  The fury of a Roid Rager is not something learned, it is an
  extension of something raging within. These warriors throw
  themselves at their foes fearlessly â€“ a terrible and wondrous
  sight to behold. Theirs is an existence of sanguine intensity,
  of fiery passion and unmitigated rage. Most Roid Ragers
  come from the uncivilized wilds, instilled by the spirit of the
  primal earth. Others consume red cap mushrooms to induce
  states of bloodlust that darkens their vision and twitches
  their muscles into life. Even when not engrossed in battle,
  Roid Ragers are furious and imposing figures, never hesitating
  when it comes time to unleash bloodshed.
