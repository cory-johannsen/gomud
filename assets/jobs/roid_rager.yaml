  description: "What drives a person to feel more alive at the brink of death? Do they hear the call of ancestors past as the blood flows – or are they simply mad? Are they filled with some primal calling lost to their brethren – or have they simply succumbed to feral urges? Are they driven into a rage fueled by ritual – or are they possessed by a primal god? Do they fight for some greater purpose – or are they simply envoys of chaos? One thing is certain - only the taste of blood will sate their vexation."
  effect: "Whenever you are Seriously or Grievously Wounded, add a 1D6 Fury Die to Damage you inflict with melee weapons."
